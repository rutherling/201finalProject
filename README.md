# 201finalProject
Team EEEK collaborates on the final project of Code Fellows 201 course.

This project incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a casual CRM app for maintaining personal relationships.

This project is complete to demo. In an actual launch, the user would start from a login page and land on their Timeline. The timeline is chronological in ascending order. It shows approaching reminders to reach out to contacts. The contacts' appointments are set when they are created using a "frequency" measurement for how often the user would like to keep in touch with that specific contact.

The user clicks on the contact's face to see a quick view of their information. From there, they can edit, remove, postpone, or mark the contact as complete. A new reminder is created when the user marks it as complete.

The overdue page is in descending chronological order. From here, a user can complete, remove, or postpone contacts in bulk.
